# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Problem Setting:
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is the phenomenon in which a customer
leaves an organization. This customer attrition is likely to influence a bank's income for various
reasons, including service, facilities, and assistance provided to consumers. When compared to
client retention, the expense of marketing to gain new consumers is prohibitively expensive.
Problem Definition:
To grow a bank's business model, it is necessary to forecast the likelihood of client attrition. This
project's primary goal is to create a supervised machine-learning model that will help in the
classification of churn consumers.

Data Source:
The data was obtained from the well-known open-source repository Kaggle.
